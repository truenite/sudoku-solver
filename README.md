# sudoku-solver
Sudoku is a logic based number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "sub-squares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which typically has a unique solution.

This project is about finding the best solution. To the moment only there are to greedy algorithms working on finding solutions, they both work quickly in a lot of cases. But I'm looking into working on an approximation algorithm or something like it.

This is just to take advantage of the svn free server. But if the time comes, you are allowed to use and modify the code here provided, please keep me posted on any changes to improve this code.

Long term goal, is to create an algorithm to look for the hardest Sudoku challenge you can create giving the most amount of numbers at the begining.
